<h3>Background</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Donna West owns a child care center. The mission of her business is to educate
	and entertain children while keeping them safe. Child care centers are a unique
	business as they must meet various different regulations. It can be difficult to
	track all of the needed information on paper as this would require a significant
	amount of data to organize and store. Our client would like an application that 
	encompasses the major aspects of her business.
	<br> 
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Donna's Daycare application will allow her to track and manage information on the
	children she is caring for, maintain a constant communication portal with parents,
	and store business-related accounting information.
	<br>
</p>

<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	Donna's daycare application will be primarily used as a mobile application that
	consists of three major modules:
	<br>

	<ul>
		<li>Accounting Module:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Maintain a chart of accounts to hold business expenses.</li>
			<li>A billing system to:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Track parent payments</li>
				<li>Have the ability to send billing reminders to parents.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<li>Child Management Module:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Maintain a record for each child containing child-related information such as:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Child's name</li>
				<li>Child's DOB</li>
				<li>Emergency contacts</li>
				<li>Guardians approved for child pickup</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Utilize a barcode reader to check children in and out of the daycare.</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Annoucements Module:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide the ability to send messages to all parents</li>
			<li>Provide the ability to communicate with individual parents</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br>
</p>
